## Movie website using API

I have created a website where you are able to search for you favourite movie and display it. 
I have fetched the data of the movie from the API provided by omdbapi.com.
When you type an invalid movie title , you are shown an error.

I have used HTML5,CSS,Bootstrap,JavaScript DOM,Promises,Fetch and the API
